The DriverPass system was a project was intended to make it easier for students to acquire drivers training. They would also be able to choose their desired driver training package, track their progress, as well as see driver notes to see where they can improve. Clients of the system would be students that would like to get driver training. I wanted to make this a web app so that it would be easily downloaded on the mobile devices as well. It would also make it easy to access off line. I think I gathered the requirement and documented everything for system very well. I also feel that I thought outside the box of what the customer wanted and added certaing features that were not directly requested but were needed to have the system run smoothly. I think I would choose to revise the sequence diagram. I think I could have went more in depth of the scenario I chose to depict. I interpreted the user needs and implemented them by taking detailed notes and making user stories. Once I completed these, it allowed me to see a detailed view of what the customer wanted. When it comes to my approach to designing software, I used the scrum approach. I think it is the most efficient way to go about developing software. I wold definitely use the sprint technique moving forward.
